#Welcome to IntelÂ® Edison :: Brainhack();


This is a brain game which can be played within two players. 
so in my project the two players are YOU & Edison! 
yaya you have to play with an AI (kind of..) which plays optimally in each move.. 
okay, here's the BrainHack(); in simple terms, 

   There are n numbers in a line displayed on the LCD. (n is even).Two players(you & edison) take turns to take a number from one of the ends of the  line LCD Screen until there are no more numbers left. The player with the larger amount of numbers wins
